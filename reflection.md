### Accessibility

I was able to complete the exercises with the help from teacher. This exercise highlights the importance of correctly labeling forms for accessibility. After completing the exercise, I tried confirming accessibility by using a screen reader. I think the exercises for this week were sufficient for reviewing an html audit and correcting the errors present. There was also an issue with more than one radio button able to be selected at a time, allowing additional practice with these types of fixes. (I have not implemented it yet).
